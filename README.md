HOMD-PICRUSt Compatibility Project

Introduction:
PICRUSt is a bioinformatics package developed by Dr. Morgan Langille and his team that allows one to predict the functionality of bacteria based on phylogeny. It is designed to estimate gene families contributed to a metagenome by bacteria or archaea using 16S rRNA sequencing. The goal is to predict the functionality of a bacterial sample by inferring the traits of living organisms that havenâ€™t been studied in depth.
The goal for the HOMD-PICRUSt Compatibility project is to extract bacterial data from the HOMD Database in order to recreate a species tree, a 16S gene count table, and an enzyme count table for use with PICRUSt
